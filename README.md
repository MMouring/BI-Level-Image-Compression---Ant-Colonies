## Background ##
This is a research project I did back in 2015-2016 while in University with a professor of mine, Dr. Khal Dhou. I wrote this source code to produce reduce BI-LEVEL images into directional movements patterns which were then compressed by reducing the string size of repeated and patterned characters. This particular compression algorithm simulated the movement of ants and how they hunt for food. It utilizes their movement patterns, use of smell, pheromone trails, etc... they would gather "food" samples. 

## Reason for Upload ##
This was a decent project that led to a publication. "A Novel Algorithm for Bi-Level Image Coding and Lossless Compression based on Virtual Ant Colonies". I have uploaded it with the intent to refactor the project to be engineered more efficiently and asthetically. (I like clean code).
